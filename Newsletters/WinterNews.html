  It is always a pleasure to share our table with all of you. It is truly satisfying to know that our efforts are enjoyed by others and, above all, that we are connecting with our guests in a real way. To be sure, the food and wine must satisfy and service has to please. We endeavor to measure well in these efforts. Ultimately, the table is all about community, connection and dialogue. We hope that you will continue to view us as a convivial place, where you may experience discourse, romance, or the simple pleasure of laughter at our table.

  </div>
  
   We've renewed all of our menus, from dinner to brunch.  We've added a variety of delicious surprises to our menu staples, along with a marvellous array of heavenly desserts. Our lunch menu has expanded to include smaller portions of many dinner offerings, and we've saved the best on our brunch menu along with many new additions. You can take a look at our new menus <a href="http://35bistro.com/wintermenus" target="_blank">here</a>.

  </div>
  
  There's an entire category of Champagne unknown to most lovers of bubbly that offers diverse styles, the taste of terroir, artisanal winemaking and, most significantly, excellent value.  Grower Champagnes are, as the name implies, Champagnes made and sold by smaller grower/producers (or récoltant) from their own grapes.  Grower Champagnes typically show terroir more than those from the "grandes marques" from major houses like Moët et Chandon (who produces over 2 million cases annually), Roederer, Veuve Clicot and Roederer - who produce a lot of wine with grapes sourced from independent growers.  They also show more of the character of the vintner himself, as these wines are most often handcrafted product made with his personal care.  They offer a broad palette of flavors and styles, often far more distinct than the large houses.<br />

We invite you to choose from our special offering of Grower Champagnes, on our List at wonderfully reasonable prices - all to entice you to enjoy the marvel of these wines, and how well they pair with our food!
