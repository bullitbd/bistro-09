Happy Holidays from the Bistro  
</p>
<p>It is always a pleasure to share our table with all of you. It is truly
satisfying to know that our efforts are enjoyed by others and, above
all,
that we are connecting with our guests in a real way. To be sure, the
food and wine must satisfy and service has to please. We endeavor to
measure
well in these efforts. Ultimately, the table is all about community,
connection and dialogue. We hope that you will continue to view us as a
convivial place, where you may experience discourse, romance, or the
simple pleasure of laughter at our table.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px; font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(153, 153, 102);" align="center">
Winter Menu  
</p>
<p>We've renewed all of our menus, from dinner to brunch. We've
added a variety of delicious surprises to our menu staples, along with
a marvellous
array of heavenly desserts. Our lunch menu has expanded to include
smaller portions of many dinner offerings, and we've saved the best on
our brunch
menu along with many new additions. You can take a look at our new
menus <a href="http://35bistro.com/food.html" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a>.</p>

Grower Champagnes
</p>
<p>There's an entire category of Champagne unknown to most lovers of
bubbly that offers diverse styles, the taste of terroir, artisanal
winemaking and,
most significantly, excellent value. Grower Champagnes are, as the name
implies, Champagnes made and sold by smaller grower/producers (or
récoltant) from their own grapes. Grower Champagnes typically show
terroir more than those from the "grandes marques" from major houses
like
Moët et Chandon (who produces over 2 million cases annually), Roederer,
Veuve Clicot and Roederer - who produce a lot of wine with grapes
sourced from independent growers. They also show more of the character
of the vintner himself, as these wines are most often handcrafted
product
made with his personal care. They offer a broad palette of flavors and
styles, often far more distinct than the large houses.<br>
<br>
We invite you to choose from our special offering of Grower Champagnes
at wonderfully reasonable prices - all to entice you to enjoy the
marvel of these wines, and how well they pair with our food!</p>
<p style="margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px; font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(153, 153, 102);" align="center">
Christmas Eve Dinner
</p>
<p>On Christmas Eve, we'll be serving a traditional Christmas dinner menu, including choices of <em>Roast Goose, Christmas Ham, Roasted Lamb</em> and
<em>Pierogi</em> in addition to selected winter menu items.  We're making a special dessert menu including, of course a <em>Bûche de
Noël</em>,
the traditional Christmas yule log. Call us to make reservations
between 4:00 and 9 p.m. We can't think of a more special occasion
to celebrate with friends and family at the Bistro.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px; font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(153, 153, 102);" align="center">
New Year at the Bistro
</p>
<p>We're offering two seatings for our New Year's Eve prix fixe <a href="http://35bistro.com/event_menus.html#newyear_menu"><u>menu</u></a>,
and a
hearty Brunch - complete with Bellini and Bloody Marys - on New Year's
Day. If you are going out for New Year's Eve, join us early, or come
later and
bring in the new year with us. <a href="http://35bistro.com/event_menus.html#newyear_menu"><u>Dinner</u></a> will be in five courses, for $75 per person, exclusive of tax and gratuity. A specially chosen wine pairing will be offered. </p>

 <p><b>Dear Friends,</b></p>

<p>What a wonderful Northwest summer at 35th Street Bistro! We are honored to have so many new guests join us, and grateful as always to all our returning guests. I hope you enjoyed your summer with family and friends – we certainly enjoyed ours with all of you.</p> 

<p>The late season warm weather found guests dining on our patio well into the night - now with Autumn upon us, the warmth of our dining room will provide haven from blustery fall days and evenings. Our menu features the bounty of local farmers and fishermen from the autumn harvest. We are beginning to fill our winter events calendar, and will send you special invitations to wine dinners and other events as they evolve.</p> 

<p>With shorter days and tighter schedules, we welcome you to join us for our new “Early Suppers” from 5pm- 6pm. These are perfect meals for those going to movies, concerts or even PTA meetings. Enjoy a variety of delicious offerings from the kitchen and be on your way within the hour!</p> 

<p>Our wine list is continuously developing as new offerings and releases arrive, and we invite you to stop by every weekday evening between 4pm and 6pm for selected wines, premium well drinks, specialty cocktails, and a special taste of the kitchen, in our version of ‘Happy Hour.’</p> 

<p>On a personal note, I truly appreciate the thoughtful comments and suggestions from our guests that help us improve how we serve you. We look forward to enjoying your company at our table – soon!</p>

<p>Ciao!<br />
